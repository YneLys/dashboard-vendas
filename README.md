Notes
The sales data is generated randomly for years 2005 through 2025, with 300 entries per year.

The year filter dynamically lists all years in this range.

The bar chart displays total sales amount grouped by month for the selected year.

The dashboard includes summary cards showing total revenue and total orders filtered by year.
